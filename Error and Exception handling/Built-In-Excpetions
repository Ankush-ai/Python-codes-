You’ve seen me write about two different named exceptions so far: NameError and ZeroDivisionError. What if I needed other exceptions?

There is an entire list of Python’s exceptions that come with the standard library. These will probably suit almost every need that you have in handling any errors or exceptions.

Here are just a few that might be important:

KeyError – A key cannot be found in a dictionary
IndexError – The index is out-of-bounds on an iterable object
TypeError – A function or operation was used on the wrong type of object
OSError – General operating system errors
